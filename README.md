## UpTask2023

### Description:

Classic web application where a logged user can register the projects that are being carried out, with the different tasks that they have. In turn, if a user wishes, they can share the project that they are doing with another user so that both can add or modify the project tasks. This personal project was done on the frontend with ReactJs/NextJs and on the backend with NodeJS/MySQL.

1. Users will be able to sign in with their account, or if they don't have one, they will be able to create one.
2. Only registered users will be able to access the web application.
3. Users will be able to change their profile photo, username and password.
4. Users will be able to register projects, with their respective tasks.
5. Users will be able to share their projects with other users, so that they can add, modify or delete tasks from the same project.
6. Administrators of the project are the only ones who can delete the project.
7. Administrators of the project are the only ones who can share the project, and remove participants from the same project so they don't collaborate anymore.
